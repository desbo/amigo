mscorefonts - Microsoft TrueType core fonts
===========

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web

From 1996 to 2002 Microsoft made freely available a set of fonts
that were designed for the web, including Arial, Comic Sans MS,
Courier New, Times New Roman, Verdana, etc.

In 2002 Microsoft cancelled the project, but because of the license
terms, the distributed files are still legally available from some
third-party websites.
